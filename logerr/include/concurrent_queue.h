/// @details It enables a limited set of concurrency-safe operations, such as push and try_pop. Here, concurrency-safe means pointers

/// @tparam T The data type of the elements to be stored in the queue.
/// @tparam Queue Underlying concurrent queue data structure. Defaults to `std::deque`.
/// @tparam AllocThe type that represents the stored allocator object that encapsulates details about the allocation and deallocation
///         of memory for this concurrent queue. This argument is optional and the default value is allocator<T>.
